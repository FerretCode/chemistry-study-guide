- hess's law
	- reactants have positive heat energy
	- products have negative heat energy

- bonding strength & type <strong>(ordered)</strong>
	- ion-ion bonding
	- ion-dipole bonding
		- a dipole is a compound where two atoms with opposite charges are bonded
			- e.g. HCl where H$^{1+}$ and Cl$^{1-}$
	- hydrogen bonding
		- a special dipole-dipole interaction where an H is bonded to a highly electronegative atom like N, O, F, etc.
	- dipole-dipole bonding
		- a bond between two dipole molecules
	- ion-induced dipole
		- when an ion approaches a NON-DIPOLE molecule, but it's influence makes the electrons respond in a certain way and it becomes a dipole molecule
	- dipole-induced dipole
		- attraction between an existing polar molecule and a molecule that becomes dipole based on the other molecule's influence
	 - london dispersion
		 - when two non-dipole molecules are temporarily attracted to each other.
		 - if the electronegativity difference between the two molecules is <.4, it is london dispersion

- <strong>inter</strong>molecular vs. <strong>intra</strong>molecular
	- <strong>inter</strong>molecular is between two molecules
	- <strong>intra</strong>molecular is the bonds inside the atom

- the impact of bond strength on molecular properties
	- stronger <strong>inter</strong>molecular forces create higher melting/boiling points, higher viscosity, etc. 
	- weaker <strong>intra</strong>molecular forces create higher melting/boiling points, higher viscosity, etc.

- what determines whether a molecule is ionic/covalent?
	- the electronegativity of the compound determines if it is ionic or covalent
	- ionic >= 1.7
	- covalent:
		- highy polar: 1.0-1.7
		- moderately polar: .4-1.0
		- non-polar: <.4

- bonding strength in relation to the periodic table
	- electronegativity goes up as the element goes up and to the right
	- metals-nonmetals bond ionically; higher <strong>inter</strong>molecular forces
	- nonmetals-nonmetals bond covalently; lower <strong>inter</strong>molecular forces

- identifying the polarity of a bond
	- ionic
		- always polar
		- DISSOLVES in water
		- metal-nonmetal
		- e$^-$ transfer
	- covalent
		- sometimes polar or nonpolar
		- nonmetal-nonmetal
		- e$^-$ are shared
