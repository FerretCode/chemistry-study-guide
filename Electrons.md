- how to identify an element based on ionization energy
	- ionization energy is the amount of energy it takes to remove an electron.
	- once you know the period the element is in, look for large jumps in the ionization energy. this big jump will tell you how many valence electrons the element has.
	- if you have a 3rd period element, with the ionization energies of:
		- 735 
		- 1445
		- 7730
	- we can see that there is a large jump between the 2nd and 3rd ionization energies. this means we can count 2 over from the third period, seeing that the element is Magnesium.
	- massive jumps means the element is likely a noble gas

- electron configuration
	- there are 4 regions on the periodic table
		- s: 2 elements per period
		- p: 6 elements per period
		- d: 10 elements per period; in the electron configuration, make sure to subtract one from the period
		- f: 14 elements per period. starting with La and Ac, the f region actually goes in front of the d region; make sure to subtract 2 from the period
	- examples
		- Be: 1s$^2$ 2s$^2$ 
		- Ga: 1s$^2$ 2s$^2$ 2p$^6$ 3s$^2$ 3p$^6$ 4s$^2$ 3d$^{10}$ 4p$^1$
- element radius ðŸ¤‘
	- radius increases down and to the right
	- positive ions are smaller than the original atom, negative ions are larger
	
- quantum numbers
	- n: the energy level. based on the period of the region (s, p, d, f) d is -1, f is -2
	- l: region. s = 0, p = 1, d = 2, f = 3
	- m: split the region into halves, (s is always 0) and put 0 in the middle. on the left side, number negatives, and on the right positives. whatever number the target element is under is the m quantum number.
	- s: spin. $\pm \frac{1}{2}$

- bohr's model
	- photons are either emitted or absorbed when moving down/up an energy level
	- absorbed going up energy levels
	- emitted going down energy levels

- electron bands
	- electron bands are the space between energy levels
		- nonmetals have large gaps; insulators
		- metals have smaller gaps; conductors
		- transition metals are semiconductors
		- the further to the right, the bigger the band
