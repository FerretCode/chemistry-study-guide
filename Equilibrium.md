- find concentration, ph, pOH, etc. using Ka, Kb, Kc
	1. create an ICE table
	2. ((Ka)(products) - (reactants)) 
	3. solve for x
	4. use x to find different values
		- -log(x) = pH
		- you can find the concentration of any given compound by looking at the ICE table's change value for the target element and plugging in x
