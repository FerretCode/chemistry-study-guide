- rate law
	- R = k[A]$^x$[B]$^y$
		- R = rate; generally, molarity/second
		- k = rate constant
		- enclosed by brackets = concentration of element
		- exponents = orders

- determine rate law from two data points
	1. if given concentrations for each element, identify one point where the others are the same or proportional and the target element concentrations are different  
	2. $\frac{R_1}{R_2}$ = $\frac{k[A_2]^x[B_2]^y...}{k[A_1]^x[B_1]^y...}$
	3. cancel out, simplify & round
	4. find the rate constant; take one point, and plug in. then solve for k

- determine rate law from graph
	1. plot the concentration, $\ln([concentration])$, and $\frac{1}{concentration}$
	2. identify the linear graph, which determines the order
		- if the first graph is linear, it is 0th order.
		- second, 1st
		- third, 2nd
