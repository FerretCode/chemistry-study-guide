- the number of bonding regions are found by counting how many spots from the leftmost element the target element is on the periodic table

- incoming/outgoing ions
	- incoming electrons are drawn with an x and an incoming arrow
	- electrons leaving are shown with an x and an outgoing arrow
	- if the ion is positive, the electron is leaving. if the ion is negative, it is leaving
	
- how do ionic and covalent compounds differ in their lewis dot structures
	- ionic structures have a charge, which must be notated using brackets around the structure with the charge
		- the electron going in/out must also be shown 
	- covalent structures do not require the bracket notation, but must show how the structures share the electrons in order to fulfill the octet rule. they also have a neutral charge

- determining the ideal dot structure
	- use VAC
		- V: # of valance electrons (count the number of elements over on the periodic table from the left of that row)
		- A: # of unshared electrons + bonds to that atom (also accounts for incoming/outgoing electrons if ionic)
		- C: V - A
