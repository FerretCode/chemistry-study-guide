- percent composition
	- (mass of one element / mass of compound) $*$ 100
	- this can also be done with moles to get % moles
	
- like dissolves like
	- polar-polar, nonpolar-nonpolar
	
- dissociation of ionic compounds in H$_2$O
	- only occurs if there is enough force from the water's <strong>inter</strong>molecular forces to break the <strong>intra</strong>molecular forces of the solute  

- how solubility changes with temp & pressure
	- temperature
		- if the compound is solid, increase temp -> products & solubility increases
		- if the compound is a gas, decrease temp -> reactants & solubility increases
	- pressure
		- does not have much impact on solids
		- increased pressure with gases increases the solubility
