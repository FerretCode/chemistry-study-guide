- reading phase diagrams

  - flat lines mean the pressure is constant; the state of matter can still change based on the temperature at any given time
  - process names
    - heat of fusion = solid -> liquid
    - heat of vaporization = liquid -> gas
    - heat of sublimation = solid -> gas
    - heat of condensation = gas -> liquid
    - heat of solidification = liquid -> solid
    - heat of deposition = gas -> solid

- q = cm$\Delta$T

  - q = heat energy gained or lost
  - m = mass
  - c = specific heat
  - $\Delta$T = change in temperature

- q = H$_?$m
  - q = heat energy gained or lost
  - m = mass
  - H$_?$ = heat of whatever
