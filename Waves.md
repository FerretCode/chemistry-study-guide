	- E = energy
	- h = planck's constant 6.626x10$^{-34}$ Js
	- c = speed of light 2.998x10$^8$ ms$^{-1}$
	- v = frequency
	- lambda = wavelength
	- avogadro's number = 6.022x10$^{-23}$ mol$^{-1}$
	
- equations
	- E = $\frac{hc}{\lambda}$ 
	- c = $\lambda$v

- photoelectric effect
	- as light shines on a metal surface, electrons can be ejected.

- photons
	- a photon is the smallest particle of light. it consists of electromagnetic energy. they do not have charge and no mass.
	- photons are emitted whenever an electron jumps down energy levels.
		- when e$^-$ drop to the 1st energy level, UV light is emitted
		- when e$^-$ drop to the 2nd energy level, visible light is emitted
		- when e$^-$ drop to the 3rd energy level, IR light is emitted
